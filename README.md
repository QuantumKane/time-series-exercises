This is my repo for Codeup's Time Series module.

## What data do you use for time series? 
- Time series data is unique in that it has a natural time order: the order in which the data was observed matters. The key difference with time series data from regular data is that youâ€™re always asking questions about it over time. An often simple way to determine if the dataset you are working with is time series or not, is to see if one of your axes is time.
