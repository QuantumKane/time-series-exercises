## What data do you use for time series? 
- Time series data is unique in that it has a natural time order: the order in which the data was observed matters. The key difference with time series data from regular data is that youâ€™re always asking questions about it over time. An often simple way to determine if the dataset you are working with is time series or not, is to see if one of your axes is time. - [What is Time Series Data?](https://www.influxdata.com/what-is-time-series-data/)

## Smoothing
- Inherent in the collection of data taken over time is some form of random variation. There exist methods for reducing of canceling the effect due to random variation. An often-used technique in industry is "smoothing". This technique, when properly applied, reveals more clearly the underlying trend, seasonal and cyclic components.
